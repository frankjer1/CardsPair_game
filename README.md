# Couple_card_game
A simple couple card game. This is one of my first projects with C and my task was the following: Develop an algorithm for simulating the game of card pairs between two players identified by their names. Initially "shuffle" a deck of Neapolitan cards. The algorithm for shuffling cards is based on the idea of exchanging in pairs the cards of the deck; an input variable allows to indicate how many times you have to trade. It is randomly chosen which of the two players should start the game. They come “face up” two cards whose position is indicated by the first player. If the two cards have the same value the player is awarded a point and the two cards are revealed. The player continues until he makes a mistake (he finds two identical cards) and the turn passes to the other player. At each turn the player has the list of covered cards and those at his disposal discoveries. The game ends when all the cards are revealed. The player who has scored the most points wins the game.
